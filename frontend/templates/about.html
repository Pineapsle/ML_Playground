    <h1>About ML Lab</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>ML Lab</strong> is an open-source platform designed to simplify and learn machine learning, model development, and deployment. 
      This web app allows you to explore and run various machine learning models to understand how they work and compare their performance.
      <strong>Dataset:</strong> I used the 
      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques" target="_blank">
        House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
      </a> 
      dataset from Kaggle, which contains features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood data to predict home prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Lower the barrier to entry for machine learning by providing user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> Ensure experiments and results can be easily reproduced and shared.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Support workflows from small prototypes to large-scale production deployments.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Enable anyone to work together seamlessly on datasets, models, and experiments.</li>
      <li><strong>Education:</strong> Provide resources and tools for learning and teaching machine learning concepts.</li>
    </ul>
