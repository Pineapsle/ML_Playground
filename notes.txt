Linear Regression (Supervised Learning with labeled data):
    What are we comparing? 
        - Actual Sales Price (y_test) vs Predicted Sales Price (predictions)

    What did the code tell us?
        Model Input:
            - Numerical features such as square footage, year built, number of rooms, etc. 
            - These were scaled so each feature contributes fairly
        
        Model Output: 
            - Trained the model using Gradient Descent to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        
        Evaluation: 
            - Mean Squared Error: 1.6 billion ~
            - Root Mean Squared Error: 39945 ~
            - R^2: 0.79823
            - R: 0.89343
            

            The model explains 79.8% of the variance in house prices and has a very strong and positive linear relationship between the features and SalePrice of houses
            As the features change, the SalePrice also tends to change in a predictable way, which aligns with my model's good performance
