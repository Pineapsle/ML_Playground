# ML Playground

  ***This is currently a work in progress. Changes are being made every day***

A collection of machine learning models and algorithms built from scratch to learn and experiment with different techniques.
Includes:
- Modular Python implementations of classic ML models
- A Flask web app to visualize and interact with models

## Directory Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains styling and HTML layout of the web application
-   `static/`: Contains all the styling
-   `templates/`: Contains all the HTML files
- `models/`: Contains different Machine Learning model implementations
- `utils/`: Utility functions for preprocessing, metrics, etc.
